This is the most detailed explanation of $GME $AMC #shortsqueeze plus the mechanism behinds stock trading: brokerage, clearing, margin, option, and so on. || Btw, re: margin / short / option, I believe all regular investors should stay away from it. I trade on cash acct only :-)

yet another tweet on robinhoodapp by @KralCTrebor, note though Robinhood restricting the trading of $GME is a separate issue of the #shortsqueeze, they are related.
